## Mission statement
To become a professional software engineer who builds meaningful software that deliver values to other people. Or, to conclude that the doors to SWE are closed and search other directions.

## The philosophy
Before one is called to "do" anything, he/she must be called to "be" the one who does such things.

## The input
Countless focused sessions, self-doubt, and struggles.

## The output
Either another project towards software engineering or switching gears to other disciplines.
Fun
